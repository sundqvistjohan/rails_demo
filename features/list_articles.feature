Feature: List articles on landing page
        As a visitor
        When I visit the applications landing page
        I would like to see a list of articles

    Background:
        Given the following articles exist
            | title                | content                          |
            | A breaking news item | Some breaking action             |
            | Learn Rails 5        | Build awesome rails applications |

    Scenario: Viewing list of articles on the applications landing page
        When I am on the landing page
        Then I should see "A breaking news item"
        And I should see "Some breaking action"
        And I should see "Learn Rails 5"
        And I should see "Build awesome rails applications"
